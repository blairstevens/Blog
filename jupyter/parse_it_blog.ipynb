    "I realize at this point that those of you who do consistently use config files are note impressed at all with the local and spin up I've just done. And that is fair, it isn't very impressive. The fact of the matter is that showing well constructed config architectures would make for a lengthy and tutorial like blog. Even if I were to write that piece it would only scratch the surface on what the options are for architectures and formats.<br/><br/>\n",
    "This is where parse_it really shines. As long as the user you're distributing to can place a file within the designated folder you are set. Parse_it reads 13 different file types and apply their values within your script. This minimizes the formatting and filetype issues we are all used to. This isn't a new engine powering your configs, instead it's a new oil to make them run that much better, and I suggest you give it a try."
